1️⃣ Image Processing & Computer Vision
📌 Problem: Implement a feature-based object tracking system using SIFT + optical flow (cv2.calcOpticalFlowPyrLK). The system should track an object across video frames even when partially occluded.

2️⃣ Deep Learning - CNN Architectures
📌 Problem: Train a CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset but with only 5% of the training data. Achieve at least 75% accuracy using data augmentation and transfer learning.

3️⃣ SQL for Data Science
📌 Problem:
Given a table transactions with columns (id, user_id, amount, transaction_date), write a SQL query to find the top 3 users who spent the most in each month of 2024.

4️⃣ Time Series Forecasting
📌 Problem: Build an LSTM model to predict the next 7 days of stock prices given a time series dataset. Use GRU as a baseline and compare performance.

5️⃣ Graph Algorithms
📌 Problem: Implement Bidirectional A Search* for pathfinding in a weighted graph and compare its efficiency with Dijkstra’s algorithm.

6️⃣ Reinforcement Learning
📌 Problem: Implement Deep Q-Learning from scratch for the CartPole environment. Achieve at least 200+ score.

7️⃣ Feature Engineering & Dimensionality Reduction
📌 Problem:
Given a dataset with 1,000 features, use PCA to reduce it to the top 10 most important features while keeping 90% variance.

8️⃣ PySpark & Big Data Processing
📌 Problem:
Use PySpark to process a 10GB CSV file containing user logs. Find the top 5 most active users per hour.

9️⃣ Probability & Statistics
📌 Problem:
A coin is flipped 10 times, and exactly 6 heads appear. What is the probability that the coin is biased (not fair)? Solve using Bayes’ theorem.

🔟 NLP - Text Generation
📌 Problem:
Train a GPT-like model on a custom dataset of medical conversations. Fine-tune it to generate accurate doctor-patient conversations.
